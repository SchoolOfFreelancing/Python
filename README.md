**Module Outline**:

1. **Introduction to Python**
   - Brief history and significance of Python.
   - Installing Python (mention different methods like Anaconda, Python.org, etc.).

2. **Basic Python Syntax**
   - Writing and executing your first Python script (Hello World!).
   - Python's indentation and whitespace rules.
   - Variables and data types (integers, floats, strings, lists, etc.).

3. **Control Structures**
   - Conditional statements (if, elif, else).
   - Loops (for, while).
   - Using logical operators (and, or, not).

4. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions.
   - Function parameters and return values.
   - Scope of variables (local vs. global).

5. **Data Structures**
   - Lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
   - Common operations on data structures (e.g., indexing, slicing, iterating).

6. **Error Handling**
   - Handling exceptions using try and except.
   - Raising custom exceptions.

7. **File Handling**
   - Opening, reading, and writing to files.
   - Using `with` statements for file handling.

8. **Modules and Libraries**
   - Importing and using modules.
   - Overview of commonly used Python libraries (e.g., math, random, datetime).

9. **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and objects.
   - Creating and using classes in Python.
   - Inheritance and polymorphism.

10. **Basic Python Projects**
    - Simple projects or exercises that allow participants to apply what they've learned (e.g., creating a calculator, a basic game, or a data analysis script).

11. **Best Practices and Style**
    - PEP 8 and Python coding conventions.
    - Writing clean and readable code.
   
12. **Additional Resources**
    - Recommend books, websites, and other resources for further learning.

13. **Q&A and Troubleshooting**
    - Provide an opportunity for participants to ask questions and address any issues they encountered during the hands-on exercises.

14. **Assessment and Feedback**
    - Optionally, you can include quizzes or coding challenges to assess participants' understanding.

15. **Conclusion and Next Steps**
    - Recap of key takeaways.
    - Encourage participants to continue their Python learning journey.

**Hands-On Exercises**:

Throughout the training module, include hands-on exercises and coding challenges that reinforce the concepts covered. These exercises can be designed to gradually increase in complexity, allowing participants to build confidence in their Python skills.

**Note**: Depending on the duration and the specific needs of your audience, you may need to adjust the content and depth of each topic. Additionally, consider using interactive development environments (IDEs) or Jupyter notebooks to facilitate the hands-on coding exercises.

Remember that hands-on training is most effective when participants have the opportunity to practice what they've learned. Encourage them to experiment with Python and build small projects to solidify their understanding.
